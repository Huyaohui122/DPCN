# DPCN
This project is all the code used in the method in paper:TriangleConv:Deep Point Convolutional Network for Vector Object Recognition in Map Space(Not yet published)


If you want to execute the DPCN model, select the train.py execution inside the DPCN folder.

Pointnet's related methods are in the pointnet_methods file, and the three methods correspond to three folders. The execution file of the Pointnet method is train_classification.py. The execution file of the Pointnet++ method is pointnet++.py. The execution file of the DGCNN method is DGCNN.py.

The methods related to graph convolutional neural networks are in the dgl_GNN folder.
